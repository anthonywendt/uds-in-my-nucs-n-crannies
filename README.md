# UDS In My Nucs and Crannies

Bundle we are using to deploy UDS Core and whatever else we want to a disconnected NUC

## UDS Tasks to build and deploy
Once connected to the cluster you can run UDS tasks to build and deploy the bundle.

```bash
# Create the bundle
uds run create-my-bundle

# Deploy the bundle
uds run deploy-my-bundle
```
